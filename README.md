# PID Box Planning

Our goal is to create a box with a spinning wheel powered by a DC motor, an arduino and potentiometer, monitored with a photointerrupter that will display rotations per minute and correct for error using a proportional-integral-derivative controller. Additionally, we would like to minimize wasted materials and use cardboard rather than acrylic as well as a friction fit design.
